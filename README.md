**Description:**  
"Make Your Garden Grow" is an online narrative, similar to Matt Huynh's "The Boat." The website follows through the lyrics of the song "Make Our Garden Grow" from Leonard Bernstein's operetta _Candide_, decorated with thematic animations and music. The user can create an account to customize this viewing experience by adding images to decorate the background of each line of the music. The placement and opacity of these images, along with the rest of the animations, are random and different for every viewing.
